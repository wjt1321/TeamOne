This week we worked mostly on our file formats.
Everyone looked at the document file formats, but we each looked at one individual picture format to share with the rest of the group.
We also discussed some of the decisions we will have to make in regards to our experiment's procedure including what number of bits to
flip, what we would like our bit-flipping program to do, and how we will rate the files after flipping bits.

In addition to what is above, we did the following:
John: Looked at the JPEG file format and posted some info for the others to see.

Adam: Looked at the PNG file format and gathered info to share with the group (not posted yet).

Lauren: Looked at the BMP file format and posted some info for the others to see. Also created a first draft of some of the procedural
questions/answers that she brought to the meeting (will be posted later).


Next week we are going to focus on picking specific files to experiment on, finding out if there is any software available to 
help us evaluate what happens to files when the bits flip, and beginning work on the bit-flipping program.
