This week we each worked on reading some of the references we had in our proposal, as we had only read a subset.

Additionally, we had a meeting and discussed which file formats we were going to investigate and how to divide the work over the next week or so.

The file formats we chose to start with were divided into three categories:

Images: .bmp, .png, .jpg

Text/Word Processing: .txt, .pdf, .doc, .docx

Executables: We are going to look into Notepad, MS Paint, Calculator, and a custom basic executable we design with very basic functionality.

We also discussed the possibility of looking into .wav sound files and somewhat equivalent Linux programs to the executables we chose, but decided that we would start with the 7 file formats and 4 executables and add more if time permits.


We then discussed what needed to be done in the next week and divided the work as follows:

Lauren: Will look into the details of the .bmp file format and try to understand how everything is set up.

Adam: Do the same for .png

John: Do the same for .jpg

Everyone: Will look into details of the text/word processing formats.  Begin thinking about classification of errors, including how to classify the individual file formats.  Write up something about the file formats investigated.
